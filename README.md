# Fitflex

Python group project

Group members: Holly Culver, Hunter Davis, Bo Cameron, and Isak Syverud

----- Description -----

Fitflex is a service that offers a experience like none other for gym rats! We used Flask to create a website that allows the user to login and plan their workout based on which muscle group they want to focus on. In addition, the user is able to check machine availability and book machines to use in 15 minute increments. Fitflex also offers a tremendous group of bookable trainers where the user can get their fitness expertise and help in 15-45 minute sessions. These trainers are available to assist the client throughout a workout and can be booked as simply as one of the machines. The profile page is a helpful tool to keep bookings organized in a fantastic page where the user can see their machine bookings, trainer bookings, and detailed workout plans. There are also simple about and logout pages.

----- Interface Details -----

We tried to make the user interface as seamless as possible, even for people that have limited experience using the internet. The overall goal was to make a website that every fitness fanatic will want to use, no matter their technical abilities. The interface should feel familiar to other useful websites and provide no difficulties while navigating through it.

----- Libraries We Used -----

We used the following Libraries/Frameworks: Flask, app, requests, shelve, and re

----- Other Resources -----

In addition to Python, we used HTML for each page and a back-end database to link the user profile information, workout plans, and bookings.

----- Extra Features -----

Although it wasn't advertised in our project plan, we added a very useful profile page to display bookings and workout plans the users already have stored.

----- Separation of Work -----

Holly was responsible for the templates for the machines page, workout plan, and profile. She added all of those templates to the database.py for the back-end database and views.py for Flask integration. Hunter was responsible for the workout plan HTML page and helped support it in the python files. Bo was responsible for the machine availability page and error checking for the machine and trainer booking pages. He also added functions for them in the python code. Isak was responsible for the trainer booking page and trainer availability page as well as helping out with functions for them in the python code. Every group member made his or her self available for help with each others responsibilities.

This project has been a great learning experience for every group member!
